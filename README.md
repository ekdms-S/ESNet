# ESNet
ESNet is a machine learning model based on convolutional neural network and convolutional block attention modules (CBAM) 
for the prediction of formation energy of crystal structure. 
It uses **density of states (DOS) of unrelaxed initial** structures as input representations, 
achieving successful performance in IS2RE task.
